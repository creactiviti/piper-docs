				<h5 class="title"><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
				
				<p>Piper is a distributed workflow engine designed to be dead simple.</p>
				
				<h5 class="title"><strong>How does it work?</strong></h5>		
						
				<p>In Piper, work to be done is defined as a set of tasks called a Pipeline. 
				Pipelines can be sourced from many locations but typically they live on a Git repository where they can be versioned and tracked.</p>
				
				<h5 class="title"><strong>Principles</strong></h5>
				
				<ul>
				    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Piper pipelines are written in plain YAML and do not require any specialized high-level language knowledge.</li>
				    <li><strong>Extensible:</strong> Easily define your own task types and extend the system so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.</li>
				    <li><strong>Elegant:</strong> Piper pipelines are lean and explicit. Parameterizing them is built into the core of Piper using a powerful templating engine.</li>
					<li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Piper has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers. Piper is ready to scale to infinity.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5 class="title"><strong>Tasks</strong></h5>
				
				<p>Tasks are the basic building blocks of a pipeline. Each task has a <code>type</code> property which maps to a 
				<code>TaskHandler</code> implementation which is responsible for carrying out the task.</p>
				
				<p>For example here's the <code>RandomInt</code> <code>TaskHandler</code> implementation:</p>
				
				<pre>
				
  public class RandomInt implements <strong>TaskHandler</strong> {

    @Override
    public Object handle(JobTask aTask) throws Exception {
      int start = aTask.getInteger("startInclusive", 0);
      int end = aTask.getInteger("endInclusive", 100);
      return RandomUtils.nextInt(start, end);
    }

  }		
				</pre> 
				
				<p>While it doesn't do much beyond generating a random integer, it does 
				demonstrate how a <code>TaskHandler</code> works. a <code>JobTask</code> instance is passed as 
				an argument to the <code>TaskHandler</code> which contains all the Key-Value pairs of that task.
				The <code>TaskHandler</code> is then responsible for executing the task using its input and 
				optionally returning a result which can be used by the pipeline's tasks downstream.   
				</p>
				
				<h5 class="title"><strong>Tutorial</strong></h5>
								
				<p>This tutorial walks you through some of the fundamental Piper concepts, objects, and their usage while writing your first pipeline.</p>
				
				<p>Here is an example of a basic pipeline definition.</p>
				<pre><code>name: Hello Demo

input:                 --+
  - name: yourName       |
    label: Your Name     | - This defined the input
    type: string         |   expected by the pipeline
    required: true     --+

tasks: 
  - name: randomNumber               --+
    label: Generate a random number    |
    type: randomInt                    | - This is a task
    startInclusive: 0                  |
    endInclusive: 10000              --+

  - label: Print a greeting
    type: print
    text: Hello ${yourName}

  - label: Sleep a little
    type: sleep             --+
    millis: ${randomNumber}   | - tasks may refer to the result of a previous task
                            --+
  - label: Print a farewell
    type: print
    text: Goodbye ${yourName}

				<h5 class="title"><strong>Architecture</strong></h5>
				<p>Piper is based on a Coordinator/Worker model.</p>
				
				<p>The <strong>Coordinator</strong> is the component responsible for accepting jobs to be executed, for distributing the tasks to workers through queues
				and for generally keeping track on where jobs are at.</p>
				
				<p>The <strong>Worker</strong> on the other hand is not aware of jobs as such and is only responsible for executing a single task given to it
				by the Coordinator. When a Worker is done with the task, it sends a message to the Coordinator &mdash; reporting the completion. The Coordinator then picks up
				the overall job associated with that task and dolls out the next task to be done to a Worker until the job is completed.</p>
				
				<p>The Coordinator and workers do not talk to each other directly. Instead a <strong>Messaging Queue Broker</strong> is used between them to talk. 
				Workers subsctibe to the various work queues by their types to recieve work. This allows Piper to scale horizontally by simply adding more workers as the work
				load increases.</p>
